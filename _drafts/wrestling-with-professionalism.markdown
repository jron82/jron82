As a self-taught programmer, one of the most important things I have had to learn is what professionalism means in the software world.

The problem is that learning how to code is different from learning the art and science of software engineering.

It is very easy to become proficient at hacking together brittle solutions that "work" under ideal conditions but that don't work when under fire.

Unfortunately, because of its ease in getting started, the PHP community has a reputation for fostering these kinds of developers. 

I used to dread every time I pushed code to production because while I knew the basics of programming, I had no battle-tested methodology to guide my development. I just relied on my own intuition and supposed cleverness.

The results were less than ideal. 

It's only when I began to read more widely on the theory of software engineering and common methodologies that I realized the need for professionalism.

While it is possible to reduce professionalism to a list of what to do such as write SOLID code, do TDD, etc; the heart of it is more akin to something Robert Martin once said.

He said that professionalism is exercising the duty to say no to management and insist on the proper engineering principles.

I totally agree with that statement. On your own personal projects you can do whatever you want, but when you do a job for someone else, you owe it to them and also to the people who will be affected by your code, to do the best job possible.

One only has to look at the ever-steady number of data breaches to understand this reality. 

I am so grateful that the programming industry is open to people like myself who don't have a degree. 

Yet it is incumbent upon us all, but especially to us self-taught programmers, to continually strive for professionalism in everything we do.

And not just for cold-hard career longevity, but for moral reasons.

We all want to live in a world where our data is as safe as it can possibly be. Where we can experience the wonders of what technology can do.

However, if the 20th century has taught us nothing, it has taught us that technology is a Pandora's box that can be used for good and for evil.

I know much has been said of late about Facebook and their lack of scruples. But regardless of who you work for, every developer needs to understand what professionalism means as a community and what it means for you personally.

In my early years, I made plenty of stupid technical decisions that lead to some inconvenient downtime. 

While embarrassing, it was very benign in it's impact. Those sort of impacts can be for the most part guarded against through rigorous adherence to best practices.

What can't be guarded against is the lack of a moral center. In part, because life is a Venn diagram and the domain of writing good code overlaps but is not enveloped by caring about the human cost of the code you write.

This is exactly the moral ambiguity behind the Manhatten project or the Manifesto of Ninety-Three. You had many extremely smart people rigorously pursuing science without thinking of the moral questions behind what they were doing.

Every profession has to wrestle with what it means to be good. Can you be a good doctor and practice euthanasia?
